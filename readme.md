# Using the MNIST DB with NodeJS for image recognition

To quickly get started just run
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

There's already a trained model stored, but you can go ahead
and train your own model!

```bash
$ node gym.js
```

Yeah... if you wanna train, you go to the `gym.js` ðŸ˜‰

## Important files to take a look at

In `api.js` there's the prediction algorithm being used.

Also `gym.js` is super interesting! It has all the logic for trainign using the MNIST
database!
